# Hyperspan

Hyperspan is a modern server-oriented TypeScript framework for building web sites and applications. Hyperspan is
positioned somewhere between a more traditional server-side framework like Express and a newer frontend framework like
Next.js. Hyperspan keeps most of the work and state on the server, but also supports using embedded React and Preact
components with dynamic islands to add rich client-side interactivity to your application right where you need it, while
shipping minimal JavaScript to the client.
